A dripstone cluster.

Dripstone caves generate underground at any height. They favor areas that are far inland, which means they're essentially never found under ocean biomes or while bordering a coast.

Dripstone blocks and pointed dripstone both hanging as stalactites and growing from the ground as stalagmites, small water wells of 1 × 1 blocks are generated in the ground. They mostly appear like regular caves, except with patches of dripstone blocks and pointed dripstone. Large dripstone clusters structures generate occasionally inside ravines. This biome also generates larger copper ore blobs compared to other biomes. Drowned are able to spawn in aquifers.‌[Java Edition only]

When generated through a single biome world, the surface is made entirely out of stone with occasional patches of dripstone.

In Java Edition, the mob spawn rate for dripstone caves is:

Mob	Spawn weight	Group size
Underground water creature category
Glow Squid	1	4–6
Hostile category
Spider	100⁄611.25	4
Zombie	95⁄611.25	4
Drowned	95⁄611.25	4
Zombie Villager	5⁄611.25	1
Skeleton	100⁄611.25	4
Creeper	100⁄611.25	4
Slime[note 1]	100⁄611.25	4
Enderman	10⁄611.25	1–4

 Spawn attempt succeeds only in slime chunks.
In Bedrock Edition :

Mob	Spawn weight	Group size

In the client, commands are entered via the chat window, which is displayed by pressing the T / Chat button.png‌[BE only] / D-pad right‌[BE only] or / key. Using the / key also enters the forward-slash that commands require as a prefix, so it is a useful shortcut. The ↑ and ↓ keys can be used to view previously entered text, including all previously executed commands.

When the cursor is at a location corresponding to some types of argument (such as an ID), a list of applicable values appears above the text box. If the argument is already containing some characters, the list displays only those values containing the typed command/text. Pressing Tab ↹ while entering commands cycles through possible commands or arguments, and can be used to auto-enter them.

Commands may also be entered in a multiplayer server's console, but are not preceded by a / when entered this way. A server owner running commands in this way is often referred to as "ghosting".

Commands in command blocks can be preceded by a slash, but it is not required.

Commands can be executed in the following ways;

Entered by a player in the chat window.
Executed by a command block or Minecart with command block.
In functions, as part of a data pack or behavior pack.
In a multiplayer server, entered in the console.
Click a Json text that has "run_command" action.‌[Java Edition only]
In behavior packs.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Executed with a WebSocket server.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Executed by an NPC.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Most commands require the executor have a high enough permission level. That means most commands are available in the singleplayer world only if cheats are enabled, and available in multiplayer server only if the player is an operator. See permission level for details.

Note: In Java Edition, in singleplayer worlds where cheats were not enabled at creation, they can be enabled on a temporary basis by opening the current game session to LAN play ( Esc → "Open to LAN", then "Allow Cheats" button and "Start LAN World"). The player does not actually need to be on a LAN or have others join. This is not permanent but allows the use of commands until the player quits the world, and changes the player makes via commands (items spawned, etc.) are saved with the world. The player can do this each time the player starts playing the world again. Note that this disables game pausing for the duration, so while open to LAN, the player should get somewhere safe or reload their world before using the Game Menu. The player can disable the LAN world by reloading the world. To permanently enable cheats, the level.dat has to be edited.

In Bedrock Edition, cheats can be toggled at any time in the "Game" tab of the settings menu. Enabling cheats in a world permanently prevents players from unlocking achievements in that world, even if cheats are later turned off.

Command guide
Syntax
In Java Edition:

Syntax	Meaning
plain text	Enter this literally, exactly as shown.
<argumentsName>	An argument that should be replaced with an appropriate value.
[entry]	This entry is optional.
(entry|entry)	(Required) Pick one of the entries that is shown.
[entry|entry]	(Optional) Pick one of the entries that is shown.
ellipsis ...	Another sub-command is required.
In Bedrock Edition:

Syntax	Meaning
plain text	Enter this literally, exactly as shown.
name: type	An argument that should be replaced with an appropriate value.
entry|entry	Pick one of the entries that is shown.
<entry>	This entry is required.
[entry]	This entry is optional.
ellipsis ...	Another sub-command is required.
Restrictions
Some commands have restrictions on who can use the command or in what context.
None: The command has no restriction.
Cheat only:‌[Bedrock Edition only] When executed by a player, the command is available only if cheats is enabled.
In Bedrock Edition, when cheats is disabled, these commands can't be used by players even if they have a high permission level. In Java Edition, if players have a high enough permission level, they can use corresponding commands regardless of whether cheats are allowed.
Dedicated server only: The command is available only on a dedicated server.
Result
After trying to run the command comes different results, including "unparseable", "failed", "successful", "error",‌[Java Edition only] and "Terminate".‌[Java Edition only]

Unparseable
If the entered command is incomplete or the arguments do not meet required argument types, the command is unparseable.
When typing a argument into the chat bar, it's noticeable if an argument does not meet the required argument type.
In Java Edition, if not meet, the argument is marked red and an syntax error message is displayed.
In Bedrock Edition, when typing in chat bar, if an argument meets the requirements, the next argument in grammar hints turns white from gray. If all arguments (including optional arguments) are entered, the whole grammar hint turns gray from white.
In Java Edition, it behaves the same as typing in the chat bar when typing in a command block.
In Bedrock Edition, when entering into a command block, if the command is unparseable, an syntax error message is outputted into its output box after closing the command block screen.
When trying to execute an unparsable command, an error message is displayed.
In Java Edition, it is "Unknown or incomplete command" or "Incorrect argument for command".
In Bedrock Edition, it is "Unknown command" or "Syntax error: unexpected ... at ...".
If a command in a function file is unparsebale, the function is unable to loaded in game.
Failed and successful
A command's Success Conditions must be met in order for the game to consider the command "successful". This is used to determine a variety of things, such as the output of a redstone comparator feeding from a command block with a command. Note that not all "successful" commands actually do something, and not all "failed" commands fail to do something useful.
Error‌[Java Edition only]
If an error occurs with the command, it means that there's a noticeable bug on this command.
Terminate‌[Java Edition only]
When running a /execute command, if the subcommands specifies 0 execution context, the command does nothing and doesn't output anything.
For example: /execute as @s run ... in a command block.

LUSH CAVES


Lush caves generate underground at any height. They favor generating underneath biomes with high humidity values, which makes them most commonly found beneath dark forests, jungles, old growth taigas and wooded badlands. It is not possible for lush caves to generate beneath forests and grassland biomes like plains and savanna as they are not humid enough. Lush caves can sometimes generate beneath oceans and deserts.

Azalea trees generate on any empty space above a lush cave, with roots consisting of rooted dirt and hanging roots that generate down until reaching the lush cave. This is most common at the surface, but they can sometimes generate inside caves if there is enough room.

Underground, moss and ores covers the floors and ceilings, along with moss carpets, grass and azalea bushes on the floors. On the ceiling, vines and cave vines with glow berries grow down and light up the caves, and spore blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip water particles. A lush cave contains springs and shallow lakes with clay where dripleaf plants grow out of them. Sometimes these lakes generate dry.

Players cannot spawn in a lush caves biome during the world generation.

Bats, glow squid, tropical fish, and axolotls are the only passive mobs that spawn, with the latter being exclusive to the biome. While hostile mobs can spawn throughout the biome, many areas have a light level greater than 0 due to the pervasive glow berries. Most hostile mobs are therefore found in large caverns more than 10 blocks high and near borders with other cave biomes.

In Java Edition, the mob spawn rate for lush caves is:

Mob	Spawn weight	Group size
Water ambient category
Tropical Fish	1	8
Underground water creature category
Glow Squid	1	4–6
Axolotl category
Axolotl	1	4–6

Generation
Amethyst geodes generate between Y=-64 and Y=30 regardless of whether "generate structures" is toggled on or off. Each chunk has a 1⁄24 chance to generate a geode. They override only caverns and mineshafts. Sometimes they are exposed on the surface, such as on beaches and underwater in oceans.

Amethyst geodes consist of three layers: an outer layer of smooth basalt, a middle layer of calcite, and a hollow layer of primarily amethyst blocks, with 8.3% replaced by budding amethyst blocks instead. Amethyst crystals generate within the structure on budding amethyst. Geodes have a 95% chance of generating with a crack, exposing its inside. Caves, aquifers, and canyons cannot cut into geodes,[1] and as such are often obstructed by them, except in cases where the crack intersects a cavern.
